# LaplacianFilter highlights the high-frequency components as a High Pass 
Filter. The Laplacian of an image highlights regions of rapid intensity 
change and is therefore often used for edge detection. The operator normally 
takes a single gray level image as input and produces another gray level 
image as output.

Please be sure that one mask is commented before run test script.
